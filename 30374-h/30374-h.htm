<h2><a name="MOONBEAMS" id="MOONBEAMS"></a>MOONBEAMS [<i>To V. Z. R.</i>]</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a glorious winter's night. Through a blue haze
one saw the ground, covered with snow, shining under
the magical moon. And the trees of the forest were
also covered with snow; great clusters glistened in
their branches. Almost as light as day. Not a bleak
light, but an enchanting one, which dazzled in the cold,
brisk air. Into the woods walked the Spirit of Art.
As he gazed at the surrounding beauty he grew sad,
and wondered why he had never reproduced such
splendor&mdash;the moon&mdash;the snow&mdash;Oh, he must try
again&mdash;Tomorrow he would do better.</p>

<p class='indent'>Then came the Spirit of History and he too grew
sad as he gazed into the quietude of the night. His
hands were soiled with blood, with dark hideous
crimes. And he asked why he had committed such
deeds&mdash;with all this beauty around him. Why could
he not have likened history to these woods where the
snow was white. Tomorrow he would do better.</p>

<p class='indent'>And then came the Spirit of Philosophy and like the
others he wondered why he had never been under the
spell of the Moonbeams before&mdash;why had he filled
the minds of men with entangled masses of dark
thought, instead of teaching them the beauty, the enchantment
of a night like this. Tomorrow he would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>do better.</p>

<p class='indent'>The three Spirits met and talked together. They
would go back to the cities and begin anew. They
would bring the spell of the woods back with them and
teach men unknown things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A New</span> Era was about to be born.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">Morning</span> dawned cold and raw, a bleak gray light
shone in the deserted streets. The three Spirits returning
from their wandering all too soon forgot the magic
spell of the woods&mdash;the snow&mdash;the Moon&mdash;and fell
to work once more among the sordid things of the day;
making Art and History and Philosophy only grayer&mdash;darker&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> in the woods where all was beauty, the Moonbeams
shone only for the fairies as they danced under
the trees, and now and then for a wistful human soul
that had strayed into the splendor of the night.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DREAM_MUFF_To_I_K_McF" id="THE_DREAM_MUFF_To_I_K_McF"></a>THE DREAM MUFF [<i>To I. K. McF.</i>]</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> more day of horror had ended for Russia. At
this hour once the lamps along the Neva would have
been lighted, the laughter of sleigh-riders would have
resounded over the snow. But now the streets were
dark&mdash;deserted save by some wandering homeless
people, seeking refuge in the night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> one seemed to know exactly what had happened&mdash;or
the cause&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was no ruler&mdash;no order&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darkness</span> and chaos.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A girl</span>, perhaps of twelve, sat huddled in a ragged
shawl on the steps of a closed church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> had been a time when a fire burned&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A mother</span>&mdash;a father&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> had gone&mdash;no one knew where. The mother
was royalist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> used to sew for a great lady&mdash;a Princess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> the jailers of a prison could tell where she
was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span>&mdash;in the life that was only a memory&mdash;was it
real&mdash;or was the biting cold&mdash;was the hunger what
had always been&mdash;her mother had taken her to the
house of the great lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her</span> eyes had opened in childish wonder, as the Princess
took her from room to room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a great couch of palest blue, among cushions that
were all lace and blue and pink&mdash;a muff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> had been carelessly thrown down&mdash;she had loved it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her</span> greatest desire had been to touch it&mdash;to feel the
soft gray fur on her face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A piercing</span> wind blew from the frozen river&mdash;the
muff&mdash;if it would come it would keep her warm&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> would put her hand in it and hold it to her heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Through</span> half-closed lids she saw the muff&mdash;curving
and swaying in the air&mdash;like a gray bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was looking for her&mdash;there were so many freezing
children in the streets&mdash;she was small for her age&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> warm&mdash;how kind of the Princess to send the
muff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maybe</span> mother will soon be home from work&mdash;we
can have supper&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boris</span> will come from school&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Boris lay dying&mdash;prisoner in the enemy's land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a pale sun struggled to shine down on the dirty
streets&mdash;on the confusion and sorrow of that Russian
city&mdash;an old Priest&mdash;dying with all the rest&mdash;of
sorrow for his land&mdash;found the frozen body of a little
girl&mdash;with hands clasped over her heart&mdash;a faint
smile on her upturned face.</p>

<h2><a name="ROSE_PETALS" id="ROSE_PETALS"></a>ROSE PETALS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Thirty</span> years had passed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thirty</span> years that I had spent in vainly trying to overcome
the love and hatred which consumed me. However
occupied I was with the pressing affairs of my
almost over-filled life I was conscious of an undercurrent
of despair&mdash;the despair that I had felt when Eve
told me she no longer loved me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were engaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whether</span> she really loved me, or whether it was only
a girlish fancy I could not tell. But the day was set
for our wedding and was not far off when one Sunday
afternoon I went to her house for tea.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mahogany table in the library was covered with
fallen rose petals&mdash;the roses he had sent her. Although
no other detail of the room has remained in my
memory, I still can see the rose petals covering the polished
surface. By some inexplicable phenomenon
those pink petals were fixed forever in my mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I left</span> that part of the country and eventually lost all
trace of Eve.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">Thirty</span> years later I had a professional engagement
with a client.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> man was ill with a cold and asked me to come to
his house&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> shown into a large, stately drawing-room. Great
portraits were on the walls, there was massive furniture,
fine oriental rugs. A fire blazed on the hearth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> I perceived it&mdash;the great bowl of roses with
fallen petals&mdash;scattered over the table</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> a knife they went through my soul&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> petals&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eve</span>&mdash;the ring she had returned, which lay in some
dark recess of my desk&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> door opened and a tall slim girl advanced&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eve</span> I cried&mdash;my eyes blurred till I could hardly see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> a strange, somewhat strained laugh, the girl
replied that she had not been named for her mother,
but it was often said that she was indeed her mother's
living portrait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> she drew aside a heavy curtain&mdash;Before my
dimmed eyes was a picture of Eve&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> Eve&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I fled</span> from the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> purpose of my visit claimed not an instant of my
thoughts. Nor did Eve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nor</span> the past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> petals only filled my mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I learned</span> from a friend that Eve had been drowned
years before in the St. Lawrence River&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> had left her husband and baby girl for another
love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> petals&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> petals everywhere.</p>

<h2><a name="IN_A_FIELD" id="IN_A_FIELD"></a>IN A FIELD</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A child</span> of three or four was playing in the tall grass
among the nodding buttercups and daisies. I watched
her as she played. She seemed a fit companion of the
flowers, this sweet babe. I longed to feel the touch of
her little fingers on my face.</p>

<p class='indent'>But as I advanced to where she was playing I
stopped abruptly with the sense of sudden chill. My
heart even grew cold.</p>

<p class='indent'>Was I having a vision, was it an intuition of the
future&mdash;or was this a meaningless phantom!</p>

<p class='indent'>I had been reading of late a modern philosopher
whose translator had made much use of that somewhat
ghostly word. Perhaps that was what had given rise
to this inexplicable thing. For as I stood there watching
the child there flashed across my consciousness a
changing vision of her destiny.</p>

<p class='indent'>It was terrible.</p>

<p class='indent'>It struck me that it might be better if she could be
taken now while innocent and sweet.</p>

<p class='indent'>I caught myself back from the act of judging life
and death.</p>

<p class='indent'>I had been the momentary victim of a freakish
fancy.</p>

<p class='indent'>I gazed at the child again, and I saw a strange thing,
as clearly as I see you now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p class='indent'>She, a young woman, was standing amidst scattered
wilted flowers, with parted lips and wide horrified
eyes. It seemed a land far off, some land under the
burning sun.</p>

<p class='indent'>She cried out, a cry of anguish. She was there to
hide from herself and tortured by the memory of what
she once had been.</p>

<p class='indent'>I saw her again, this time on the sea, still trying to
escape from herself, from the tyranny of her lost
innocence.</p>

<p class='indent'>And then I saw her in a rapid succession of scenes,
again and again&mdash;gambling places, drinking,&mdash;sometimes
listless and distraught&mdash;sometimes forced and
eager&mdash;with wonderful, costly jewels. But they were
too heavy. The price of them was weighing upon her
soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> a grave, alone under leaden skies of some
Northern country. No flowers now, only the moaning
wind&mdash;the cold rain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I lifted</span> the child in my arms and kissed her.</p>

<h2><a name="INCALCULABLE" id="INCALCULABLE"></a>INCALCULABLE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was one of those gray days so frequent in Paris
in the late fall. A drizzling rain was coming down
through the bare branches of the trees and a cold mist
was rising from the Seine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I felt</span> out of tune with the universe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rain irritated me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> cheer my drooping spirits I took refuge in the
Louvre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> I found no solace in the cold white statues of
the lower floor. I ascended one of the broad staircases&mdash;the
headless beauty of the Victoire de Samothrace
only made me shudder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I passed</span> through the halls lined on either side with
the masterpieces of French and Italian and Spanish
Artists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> in my depressed state of mind had no right to
be there where faces of Madonnas smile down as one
passes and deserve a freer look than mine to turn on
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I wandered</span> out again into the street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I walked</span> up the quai which winds along the river and
where the quaint well-known bookshelves are built displaying
to the passerby rare old books and piles of
rubbish alike.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Despite</span> the rain several students were eagerly looking
through these stores of hidden wealth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the Parisian would say ils bouquinaient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> I too began to pick up at random several old volumes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> English one caught my glance&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a copy of Browning&mdash;old and tattered&mdash;and
pencil-marked. Turning to the fly-leaf I saw a name,
written in a woman's hand&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Victoria O'Fallon</span>&mdash;Paris 18&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I looked</span> up&mdash;and saw far back into now almost
forgotten years of my life and there flashed into unaccountable
and extraordinary vividness in my mind the
remembrance of a western mining camp and of a girl,
Vicky O'Fallon. She was a little red-headed beauty,
who dreamed and talked of nothing but the stage, who
longed to study and to travel, to release her life from
the coarse and rude environment in which she lived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> I questioned almost passionately, could that little,
discontented Irish girl be the same one whose name on
an old yellowing page was intriguing my thought?
How came her book here among these old volumes?
Had some strange fate transplanted her to Paris in the
year 18&mdash;? Had her dreams come true and was she on
the stage in this great city of the world? I asked of
the bookseller how this copy of Browning had come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
into his hands. He did not know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I could</span> not dismiss this girl, I could not forget the
book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Somewhere</span>, somehow she had read Browning. She
obsessed my mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> possessed my waking hours. I wandered from
theatre to theatre, watching at the stage doors, and
saw play after play, always in the hope of discovering
this girl I had scarcely known. I studied hotel registers,
old play-bills, and always old books. I had not
thought of her for years and now I desired more than
anything else in life to see once more her dancing blue
eyes and hear again her laughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> it was all in vain that I scanned faces in the
streets, in railway stations, in passing cabs. I could
find no trace of Victoria O'Fallon.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">Years</span> passed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> travelling one dull English day from London
to Glasgow. In the railway carriage toward night I
fell into desultory talk with a sad uneasy looking man
who shared the compartment with me. At some turn
in the conversation he told me his name was O'Fallon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> worn copy of Browning seemed almost to take
form in my hand&mdash;and Victoria&mdash;her dream, her
hair, her enchanting laugh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> moments I was too dazed to speak. Then I managed
to ask if by any chance he was related to a girl
Victoria O'Fallon. He stared at me in silence, while
a look of hatred and despair distorted his face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Finally</span> in a choked voice he breathed rather than
spoke&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> just out of prison because of Victoria O'Fallon&mdash;she
was my niece. I sent her to Paris. She was on
the stage, just one night&mdash;I struck her&mdash;she fell on
a chair&mdash;her back. She's dead now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> gazed vaguely out into the gathering darkness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> he seemed to remember me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a French Count he began, but his voice
sank into silence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I sat</span> as if I had been turned to stone.</p>

<h2><a name="A_NEAPOLITAN_STREET_SONG" id="A_NEAPOLITAN_STREET_SONG"></a>A NEAPOLITAN STREET SONG</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Alone</span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A city</span> full of lights, of pleasure. The sea singing to
itself as it rolled quietly into the harbor. A glow of
light on distant Vesuvius. Gay throngs of people
passing to and fro in the summer evening. Alone.
For the first time in her life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A heavy</span> heart&mdash;there was no joy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> had come to Naples on their wedding journey.
Her brief happiness had been taken&mdash;torn from her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ashes.</span><br />
He&mdash;cold&mdash;rigid&mdash;lay in the adjoining room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> candles burned. A nun prayed. Monica leaned
out of the window.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Through</span> her tears she saw a star shining in the night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A star</span> of sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sea&mdash;they had gone together on its blue waves
to Capri&mdash;to Sorrento&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Was</span> it some terrible nightmare&mdash;would she awaken
and find him near.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> a distant street came the sound of music&mdash;gay&mdash;lively&mdash;a
Neapolitan street song.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> could there be joy. The sound was agony. An
organ might have soothed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Had</span> there ever been a time when gay music delighted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">O Sole mio</span> sang the clear voices of the street singers.
They drew nearer&mdash;and stopped under the window.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monica's</span> wounded inward self cried out for silence</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> world was drear. There should be no joyful
singing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> looked down absently. A young girl stood a little
apart from the singers. Monica noticed her&mdash;and
their tearful eyes met.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> singers also could know sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suddenly</span>&mdash;her own seemed lightened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monica's</span> soul surged forward. She wanted to comfort,
to help this brown-eyed girl. Perhaps her grief
was harder to bear.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Passionately</span> musical&mdash;Janet Knott had been sent
abroad to study.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Homesick</span> and weary she wandered about in a strange
city, knowing not even the language.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gray sky&mdash;the grayer buildings. Was there not
in this city a kindly soul&mdash;one she could talk to&mdash;confide
in&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a narrow street&mdash;suddenly the rich deep tones of
an organ reached her soul&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Built</span> in among great buildings a small Church.
There at least she could find comfort&mdash;and the organ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Was</span> it a Requiem&mdash;minor chords&mdash;the keys seemed
to sob under the pressure of withered hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Janet</span> sobbed too. She was homesick. Lonely&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> music stopped and the old organist came down
and spoke with her. He asked why she was crying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Your</span> music is so sad, she whispered&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ah</span>, my child, that is life&mdash;I am told to compose a
Requiem&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> youth, filled with the joy of living, could play
these minor chords.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I too</span> was young once&mdash;A student at the University.
I loved life then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I danced</span>&mdash;composed only waltzes&mdash;sang love
songs. But now&mdash;sorrow has played on the chords
of my heart&mdash;to teach me these deeper tones&mdash;to
teach me music for the Passion&mdash;for the Crucifixion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> must learn, my child, that through sorrow men
accomplish great things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> they weep they send out tones into the world
that men remember and cherish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beethoven</span> lived and suffered&mdash;and has left to the
world things of immortal greatness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> now&mdash;go&mdash;else I shall sadden you beyond your
years&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Slowly</span> Janet walked through the darkening streets.
The words of the organist filled her mind. She felt
prophetically her heart must pass through fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Would</span> she be strong enough&mdash;or would weakness&mdash;desire
for joy&mdash;conquer and kill the power within.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> homesick girl of seventeen has given place to a
worldly wise young woman of twenty-five.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> more longing for the land across the seas. The
power within still sleeps&mdash;Paris. With its pleasure
haunts, its lights, its theatres&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Janet Knott</span>&mdash;the center of an admiring coterie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>&mdash;she
plays light music&mdash;waltzes. The joy of being
alive&mdash;the whirl of a great city&mdash;subdued laughter
of groups of men and women walking in the moonlight&mdash;the
flowering chestnut trees&mdash;the roses&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Races</span> of Longchamps&mdash;gay colors&mdash;a world of
excitement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Life</span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Its</span> waves swept over her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> had chosen between this and art&mdash;fulfillment of
the Soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sometimes</span> shadows of her power rose&mdash;beckoned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> consoled these moments with coquetry. A success&mdash;flowers</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> war broke out. Excitement still filled her. It
would soon be over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Something</span> new&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Then</span>&mdash;one by one all the men she had known,
flirted, danced with, left for the front. To die. That
the enemy should not pass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> in danger. Death and sorrow near.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> best in Janet Knott gradually awakened. A desire
to help grew until she could contain it no longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> Sunday evening she went to Notre-Dame for
Benediction&mdash;Kneeling in the shadows of the pillars
she heard the organ&mdash;sad agonizing chords<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorrow</span> has played on the chords of my heart to
teach me these deeper tones&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> memory of the little church, of the old organist&mdash;of
herself, the former Janet, the homesick child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her</span> gift&mdash;was it dead or only sleeping? Could she
awaken it&mdash;Spin a new life on the webs of war&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> shadow of the Janet of seventeen wept over the
wasted years.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> seemed to be no end. The war-filled years
crept slowly onward, each day bringing more sorrow&mdash;more
death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Janet</span> was torn in two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> human pleasure-loving side lay bleeding&mdash;dying
inch by inch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> other, with tones of deepest beauty, rose above it,
sighing that it must take such tragedy to break down
its prison bars&mdash;that it might live.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> rose&mdash;comforting Janet in many a weary hour&mdash;comforting
the wounded, the dying. In a village
church which had been turned into a base hospital she
often played&mdash;and as they listened some pain was
eased, some picture rose of happy fields, of homes.
Would they see them again&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this tragedy of nations she had found herself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Found the purpose of her life. Her art had come into
its own&mdash;had comforted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Death</span> from a shell might take her&mdash;as it took thousands
each day&mdash;but she was fulfilling the mission
of her soul.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> night the Church Hospital lay sleeping. Very
softly Janet crept to the organ loft&mdash;softer still she
played to the moonlight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> was rapidly improving. His wounds had not been
serious. Something&mdash;very soft, faint&mdash;woke him.
For a minute he could not recall his surroundings&mdash;and
he rose up&mdash;but a sharp pain in his shoulder
brought back the memory of the trenches, of the
horror&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I must</span> be dying&mdash;I hear faint music&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> moon shone on something white&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> angel&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fully</span> awakening to his surroundings Hugh Brandon
realized that it was not death&mdash;not an angel&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> would go and find out for himself&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Janet</span> barely touched the keys. Softer and softer
grew the tones. He came nearer&mdash;fascinated as if
by a magic presence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Their</span> eyes met&mdash;in the moonlight. They knew that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
no matter what happened to the rest of the world&mdash;no
matter what happened to their own bodies&mdash;their
souls were met for all Eternity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a flash from the unconscious&mdash;one of those
strange illuminations which occur perhaps once in a
hundred lifetimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Play</span> on, he whispered. Play for me&mdash;for England&mdash;whose
son I am</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> noon when they had eaten&mdash;Hugh and Janet
slipped away. She played for him. The tones were
richer than before. Into the sadness had been poured
the burning heat of pure love.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> had both known what they had thought was
love,&mdash;among flowers, dances, the lovely but artificial
things of life&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> here&mdash;among the dying&mdash;blood, privation, life
divested of its mantles and laid bare&mdash;the true love
sprang up between these two. Something more than
love. A perfect understanding of each&mdash;like the
treble and the base of a symphony&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the still hours of twilight Hugh and Janet would sit
in the organ loft together, speaking the enchanted

<p>"<i>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;It is clear that the transmutation which the
subject of the Allegro undergoes just before the close
of the symphony is of the same psychological order as
that of the Fate motive&mdash;a change from clouds to
sunshine, from defeat to triumph.</i>"</p>

<p class='right'><i>From Ernest Newman's criticism of Tschaikowsky.</i></p>


<p class='indent'>To all outward appearances there was nothing unusual
about the rehearsal. The musicians had assembled&mdash;and
very softly the andante of Tschaikowsky's
Fifth Symphony in E minor had begun&mdash;a dream-like
wave&mdash;which little by little swelled&mdash;and
dropped again&mdash;now as a hymn&mdash;a plea for unknown
happiness.</p>

<p class='indent'>Dasha Ivanovna Tortsov played. Since the first
time she had heard this Slavic Symphony, one snowy
night in Moscow, she had loved it. Queer yet beautiful
ideas were brought by it into her mind&mdash;<i>The
String Movement</i>&mdash;plentiful crops&mdash;full hearts of
joy&mdash;But how could her heart be joyful? What
right ever had she to be playing Russian music? She
had deserted&mdash;left&mdash;talked against Russia, exaggerated
the oppressions, the sufferings, had ridiculed
all that others held sacred&mdash;<i>Dolce</i>&mdash;the running<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
waters of Russia in the summer, a clear sky&mdash;then
the coming of fall with the brown leaves&mdash;a gradual
decline into winter.&mdash;A storm&mdash;oh&mdash;how she had
loved storms&mdash;in bygone days&mdash;then. And again
still weather&mdash;the dance of gypsies at a fair&mdash;very
low&mdash;a sound&mdash;a murmur&mdash;</p>

<p class='indent'>She scarcely heard the orchestra leader's shrill
whistle, his calls of Back to letter B&mdash;or letter F&mdash;or
Strings softer there</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Russia&mdash;wistful&mdash;half-fulfilled thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Longing</span> she had never known before took possession
of her soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gloom</span>&mdash;and yet the very depth of a Russian's heart,
pouring itself out in the mystic symphony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Then</span>&mdash;a lighter mood&mdash;again the green woods and
water&mdash;oh for the happy song of the boatman on the
Volga.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Higher</span> and higher rose the trepidation. She was
tense&mdash;what was it&mdash;what was breaking loose
within her&mdash;Higher and higher rose the waves of the
music&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silence</span>&mdash;again the strings&mdash;balm&mdash;the call of the
woods&mdash;the odor of pines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thunder</span>&mdash;rolling thunder&mdash;<br />
&mdash;and peace&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bluebells</span> on the grass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p class='indent'>To onlookers she was but a young musician&mdash;a little
pale&mdash;with strange Slavic eyes&mdash;and no human
being could perceive the emotions&mdash;the mental suffering&mdash;as
if the cords of her heart were being tightened
until they must break&mdash;her former self must die
that she could reawaken&mdash;A conquered self.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p class='indent'>The last movement was beginning. Dasha Ivanovna
was hardly conscious that she played. The music
swept around her&mdash;military&mdash;a call&mdash;to what? It
was of marching&mdash;a faint&mdash;far away&mdash;Somewhere&mdash;out
of childhood days rose the memory of her tiny
hands applauding Russian soldiers as they passed&mdash;But
now like a deserter she had turned away from the
once loved country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Troiki</span>&mdash;on glistening snow&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> then what she always termed the Triumphant
part of the symphony&mdash;where each time she played
it, she knew not why&mdash;but A&iuml;da&mdash;the triumphant
entry of the King</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhadames</span>&mdash;<br />
and Cossacks riding madly&mdash;furiously</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Splendor</span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dasha</span>&mdash;no it was not the leader's whistle&mdash;it was
an inward voice&mdash;no one else could hear its piercing,
agonizing sound&mdash;only the depth of her very being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
knew&mdash;a call&mdash;Russia&mdash;the land of her fathers
that she had deserted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cossacks</span> riding in the Steppes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> dropped her bow and moved trance-like from the
hall&mdash;</p>

<p class='indent'><span class="smcap">Russia</span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p class='indent'>Dasha Ivanovna was once more in the land of her
forefathers. Already she had walked in familiar
streets, had seen familiar buildings. Alone&mdash;something
within her did not need the outside world. Not
lonely therefor. And a strange kindling happiness in
her soul&mdash;a sense of triumph over her former Nihilistic
self.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> saw no friends&mdash;the ones of former days&mdash;Nihilists.
They were perhaps hiding in foreign lands&mdash;or
were in the darker seclusion of some Siberian
Prison. But there rose no longing for these friends,
no wish at all for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> longer was she Dasha Ivanovna Tortsov the Nihilist&mdash;the
free thinker&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peace</span> had come to her&mdash;she wanted Peace for
others&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> longer a desire to see those in power killed&mdash;only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the dark forests and running waters, the wild flowers
in the woods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joy</span> filled her&mdash;Forgotten lay the haunting fear of
other days&mdash;the gloom cast by Prison walls&mdash;which
had seemed ever to draw in upon her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> live&mdash;to let live&mdash;to send up Hymns of joy.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p class='indent'>It was on the steps of Saint Isaac's Cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dared</span> she advance&mdash;dared she go in to the splendor
of the Altars&mdash;to pray&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> ever the Fifth Symphony like a guiding spirit
seemed to whisper at her ear&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Triumphant</span> over Defeat</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Light</span> out of gloom&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dasha</span> filled her days with joy. The joy of being
alive, of being freed from herself&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> saw the sky and heard the laughter of children in
the street&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Somehow</span>&mdash;in New York&mdash;when she had belonged
to the orchestra she had never noticed the sky. A
few months more and the snow would come&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A winter</span> in Russia&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> early summer months passed quickly&mdash;until that
first terrible day of August, 1914, when all the horrors
of the world were set loose and the monsters from the
under-world of men's minds were stalking unashamed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> Dasha had put aside her Nihilistic feelings&mdash;she
laid them still farther from her now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A purpose</span> to serve her Russia lifted itself high and
strong before her soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> smiled as she thought of death.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MAD_ARTIST" id="THE_MAD_ARTIST"></a>THE MAD ARTIST</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Faintly</span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Speak</span>, speak&mdash;Angel or demon, or both, speak to me
before I throw you into the sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> storm raged in all its fury around the house, and
the rain beat down&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Speak</span>, or I'll break you into a thousand pieces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the only answer was the smile of the Angel with
the uplifted eyes and the outspread wings as if she was
about to ascend to Heaven. The marble Angel that
was to have been his masterpiece! His last gift to
man was now his hated treasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Night</span> came on and with it the fury of the storm increased&mdash;and
still the mad artist now implored, now
threatened. The Angel smiled and looked Heavenward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I chose a model for my masterpiece, he murmured,
she was beautiful, but had not the face of that
Angel. How came I to copy the image in my heart
and not the living one that for months was each day
here in my studio.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> storm raged without, and within the artist groped
for light, clung to the shreds of memory. His madness
was increasing, his head seemed miles away.
What had he been thinking of just then, had he seen
a woman rise from a tomb&mdash;no, it was the Angel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> must get to work and finish it. But it was finished.
Vaguely he remembered dismissing his model.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Speak</span>&mdash;with a faint cry of anguish he rushed to the
statue. Speak, image of my lost Louise! But no,
you are cold marble, you have no life, no warmth&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Still</span>, it must be the girl I loved. It is her mouth,
her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wind moaned around the house, seeming to call
the name of Louise. The mad artist wept, and groped
for light, for memory. Vaguely he could see, 'way
back in some half-forgotten period, a nurse leaning
over his cot. The noise of battle still rang in his ears&mdash;but
that was all past, in his other life&mdash;now there
were phantoms and the image in his heart of the lost
Louise. Why had he chosen that name. That name
made him think of running water. Where was reverie&mdash;Oh
yes, it was the statue&mdash;well it must die.
Never should men see his masterpiece that had cost
him all the joy of life. For he had likened the features
of the Angel after Louise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Speak</span>, demon, he implored. Take on a woman's
voice.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> storm had ceased and the sun shone brightly on
the wet grass and the flowers of a day in June. One
ray peeped in at the window of the studio and saw the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Angel broken by hammer and chisel on the floor. Its
smiling face seemed to forgive all the madness of the
night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> what strange nightmare was he awakening? At
the sight of his loved and hated Angel broken at his
feet, his senses were slowly returning&mdash;But with
what pain they came&mdash;as if his head must break.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> could not think yet&mdash;he would later on. He had
been mad&mdash;he remembered the doctor saying so&mdash;In
France&mdash;shell shock.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> had come over him as he stood by the gate of the
Chateau. Then a hospital. Afterward all had been
darkness, a horrible groping amid a thousand broken
memories, phantoms which had shrouded him. But
now it was over. He was sane&mdash;life, life! Oh what
joy to live again, as one risen from the tomb&mdash;he
would travel out into the world&mdash;far from his studio.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> attendant entered bringing lunch to the mad
artist and found him dead, his lips pressed to the
marble ones of his Angel, the image of Louise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> was only one of his many phantoms.</p>

many hours will have passed since the iron door of
my cell was unlocked and I was taken along the corridors
of the prison and across the yard to the place
of execution. Already I shall know for myself what
lies on the other side, I shall have ceased forever, I
hope, to count the bars of my iron door, my sole occupation
and the one thing which keeps me from thinking
too much of the past, so bitter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Why</span> did they come today. Did they think they would
ease my pain, did they think it was charity to play for
us, here in the prison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a large house on the outskirts of the town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the living room a fire blazed. Soft shaded lights&mdash;a
contrast to the blizzard raging outside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A small</span> gathering of people for informal afternoon
tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia Stuart</span> had come in rather late. She sat comfortably
on a huge divan near the fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A picturesque</span> magnetic figure, dressed in purple,
with beautiful warm furs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rather</span> dreamily she gazed at the fire. And mused
to herself on the strangeness of life&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ashes</span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Something</span> within her long ago had died. And the
new Lydia had risen, stronger, better, for the horrible
struggles against herself&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Against</span> him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her</span> art had been created by the ashes of a dead love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> had conquered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the other side of the fireplace was standing the
man she had once loved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> another town she had begged him not to see her&mdash;not
to write.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> later they had met unexpectedly at a ball&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was music&mdash;many flowers&mdash;brightness&mdash;laughter&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">His</span> arms had held her close as they danced&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> triumph gave way to a new compelling mood.
She was choosing between two loves&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> cold, calculating eyes he had watched her as she

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> last&mdash;only ashes&mdash;where once had been love&mdash;</p>

man&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span>&mdash;risen from the ashes&mdash;walked out into the
snow and cold. She felt her release to a new freedom.
She could meet him again&mdash;without harm&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="NANCY_TURNER" id="NANCY_TURNER"></a>NANCY TURNER</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Nancy Turner</span>, Teacher of Dancing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> inscription engraved on a brass plate had become
as familiar to me as the grim row of terraces and the
solemn-looking door to which it was nailed. How
many times had I not passed it, as I walked from my
house to my place of business. Passed it on snowy
mornings and gray misty evenings, or in the summer
time when birds chirruped and sang and the sun
smiled down upon the earth. I had read it over and
over again, as I was wont to do the names of the
streets and squares, especially on my homeward walk.
L&mdash;&mdash; Street&mdash;a turn to the right, the inscription on
the door, B&mdash;&mdash; square&mdash;and I was already half-way
home to my cheerful fireside, to my books and
my violin; where Shakespeare, Milton and Beethoven
would be ready at my whispered call to help me while
away the hours of the evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> once as I passed this certain row of terraces, something,
hitherto unknown, seemed to take possession of
me. I began to see the sign in a new light and wondered
why I had taken it for granted all these years,&mdash;and
never once thought that indeed Nancy Turner
must be a real person. It was true that I had never
seen anyone enter the house, but then I passed it at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
hours when people would not be likely to be taking
dancing lessons. I began to wonder at my being so
absent-minded that I could for years read these five
words and never have them leave more than a slight
impression.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> suddenly I found myself wondering what sort of
person this dancing teacher was. Surely young and
talented, perhaps even beautiful. I mused about her
half the way home. I even wove some strange and
fanciful day dreams about her&mdash;when to my sorrow
I remembered I was no longer young!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> therefore Nancy Turner was also middle-aged.
For had not the inscription bearing her name been on
that door ever since I was a young boy&mdash;perhaps long
before my time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> days I thought about her and failed in explanations
to myself, of my sudden strange fascination for
an unknown name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days flew by, and my curiosity to meet and talk
with her only increased.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> one cold and gloomy evening I took courage and
knocked at her door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> my surprise the gruff voice of a man bade me enter.
I found myself in a small room, blue with smoke and
poorly furnished. An old man was cooking supper,
as he hummed some weird old gypsy tune. He seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
scarcely to notice me and displayed neither surprise
nor dissatisfaction at my sudden appearance. I murmured
some excuse about being in the wrong house,
that I was looking for Nancy Turner in order to learn
about some of the newest dance steps.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now you know the story of my life, of hers, and
of your own, he said with a sigh. Strange that I
should have asked your name. And stranger still that
you came here as if led by the hand of Fate. But now
that we have discovered that we are half brothers I
hope you will come often to chat with me, here in this
house where we were both born. I will tell you more
about our beautiful mother, of her fame when she
danced at the opera, of the days long ago when she and
my father and I lived here so happily, of the tragedy&mdash;but
no&mdash;let us forget the past. She forgave&mdash;therefore
our friendship must be without shadow from
the start.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PAWN-SHOP_KEEPER" id="THE_PAWN-SHOP_KEEPER"></a>THE PAWN-SHOP KEEPER</h2>


<p class='indent'>I am an old man and life has long since lost the
glamor it once held for me. The thrills of youth are
no more, novelty is a forgotten word, and things that
once would have made my heart leap now leave me
cold. Old age indeed is in itself a punishment for the
follies of youth and sad is it to await alone the coming
of death without some loved face near. For one by
one the friends of bygone days have dropped by the
roadside and I have been left alone to follow my weary
way. Happy they who die while still young and do
not know the solitude of a lonely old man.</p>

<p class='indent'>Day after day, as I sit behind my counter, or warm
my old hands by the cheerful blaze of the fire, do customers
come to me to buy something or perhaps to sell
some loved relic in order that they may live.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> of them faces strange and new. They look at me
as if to say Why this one dried leaf of another year
left on this tree? Aye, and why am I left&mdash;Why
among these young, green leaves am I the only withered
one? Why were no companions left to cheer me?</p>

<p class='indent'>But these are questions I can not answer, for I know
not the ways of God.</p>

<p class='indent'>As I sit here musing over the past, faces I have
known come back to me and I love to wonder what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
fate held in store for them, as advancing, the filmy
mists of their futures were slowly lifted until the last
veil was drawn back and the story of their lives was
told.</p>

<p class='indent'>The snow is falling and covering in white the grim
rows of houses opposite my little shop, the streets are
deserted save by a few hurrying pedestrians and some
merry school children going down to the frozen river
for an hour's skating before dusk&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> I am here before the fire, dreaming and waiting,
for yesterday brought me an experience very different
from my usual monotonous life.</p>

<p class='indent'>Was it all some phantom? It must be.</p>

<p class='indent'>The Miriam that I have longed for all these years
was not here yesterday, did not sit in this very chair.
It must have been a vision, the mere fancy of an old
man's mind. For how many times in sleep has not the
same dream come to me as a whispered message from
another world, from her grave even&mdash;and on awakening
I always seemed to know that her journey
through life was at an end.</p>

<p class='indent'>But no, it was not a phantom, for here is the necklace.
Then it was not a dream. Fate has really sent
her to me so we can cheer each other in these, the last
hours of our earthly lives.</p>

<p class='indent'>But will she come back today as she promised? Or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
will she depart again, this time for good, so that I
shall see her no more until I have crossed the River of
Death.</p>

<p class='indent'>O Miriam, come to me, I need you more now than
ever before. Come, I am waiting with outstretched
arms.</p>

<p class='indent'>Yes, she is coming. I see the yet distant form of
the one I love. She is approaching, coming ever nearer.
Miriam, what happiness we shall yet have together, in
the dusk of our lives, what pleasant hours here by the
fire&mdash;</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p class='indent'>Death, kindly death, come now to me. She passed
by my shop and turned the corner and went toward
the station. Her heart then is still cold as stone.</p>

<p class='indent'>It was the money I paid her for the necklace that
bought her ticket to another town&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Only</span> something far away&mdash;a memory perhaps</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> tragedy lay hidden in her heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> years ago this small house had been occupied

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> stopped abruptly and shuddered like one accused

<p><span class="smcap">I do</span> not know you, he managed to say. He had a flat
thin voice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> once lived in this house, the woman said menacingly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> shuddered again and stepped back</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> young man began to wonder. Could she be the
sweet French woman that the village children had
loved&mdash;<br />
that he, the eldest of the little group had in his boyish
awakening been romantic over&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gypsy sensed his admission of her charge.</p>

head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old creature nodded and fixed him with her fierce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> not your mother</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neither</span> was the woman you called by that name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> young man gasped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> remembered his adored mother whose grave he
visited every Sunday morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> made an effort to think that this was only a gypsy&mdash;an
impostor&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> woman was speaking&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neither</span> your father nor mother ever knew that you

<p><span class="smcap">Their</span> little boy is dead</p>

woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is Christmas eve</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Through</span> the window Katherine has been watching a
procession of people hastening to midnight Mass at
the Cathedral. Women&mdash;dressed in the picturesque
garb and coif of Brittany&mdash;men and children&mdash;What
peace is theirs&mdash;they know of the Christ Child&mdash;of
his Mother&mdash;and no streams of lowest passion&mdash;can

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> memory of the Sultan rose and fell each time at
the sight of the candles, the acolytes in prayer. A

<p><i>All ye are Christ's and Christ is God.&mdash;Saint Paul</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">High</span> in the mountains,<br />
above the cities<br />
where all was calm&mdash;peaceful&mdash;<br />
a golden moon shone down<br />
lighting bare branches and fallen leaves&mdash;<br />
lighting the dark pines&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> shone on the lake, in a valley in the mountains,<br />
making golden streaks upon the waters&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Christ</span> walked on earth that night and stopped near
the shore of the lake</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> looked into its depths&mdash;<br />
at the sky&mdash;at the moon&mdash;<br />
and felt the cold night air on His Face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A great</span> sadness had overcome Him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">God</span> had reflected a corner of Heaven to men on Earth&mdash;<br />
and they did not pause in pleasure or in sorrow&mdash;<br />
no one felt the beauty of those mountains.</p>

again looked into its depths&mdash;</p>

men grappled with death<br />
not beautiful death<br />

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> killed&mdash;were killed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> agonizing sorrow of Gethsemane again swept
over Christ, as He stood by the Lake<br />
and wondered if men would ever be worthy of the gift of life&mdash;<br />
if they would ever make it beautiful&mdash;and not terrible&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were endowed with a certain freedom&mdash;<br />
they used it to make wars&mdash;<br />
to think of barbarous machines that would kill and torture&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fiendish cries of battle were in the great valley
below&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tears</span> filled His eyes as He thought of the unprepared

on both sides of the battle line&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> broken homes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">His</span> heart was breaking in sorrow for the people He

and still hearing the noise of battle&mdash;<br />
walked under the pines&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> came upon a small cabin&mdash;<br />
sheltered by tall trees&mdash;<br />
the roof was covered by fallen leaves&mdash;<br />
a light shone from the window.</p>

on that night of beauty in the mountains&mdash;<br />
when below&mdash;the world was being torn&mdash;ravaged&mdash;</p>
